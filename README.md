# Year3RayTracing
 Hello reader,

This project was done in collaboration with David Moli for the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the context of the third year course ELEC-H304 - Physique des télécommunications - 202223 under the teaching of De Doncker Philippe.

The goal of the project was to study using complex electromagnetic wave formulas developped in the course the propagation of different Antennas from outside a warehouse into the warehouse and to model the power as well as the electrical field in each field of the map. A very optimised c++ code was written and the goal of finding where to put relay boxes to increase the power transmission was met. The report is shown in "report" section. Enjoy !
